WARNING!:
I don't plan to support this code. If it doesn't work for you bad luck. It worked for me. Some xpaths may change on IMDB site so the code may require some changes in future. I tried my best to create xpaths as general as possible.

[BACKGROUND]
I'm a big movie geek. I used to have close to 500 rated movies on Imdb. I used old email as login method. I closed that email account and moved to gmail. It was a sunny beautiful day, people were cheerful and optimistic about future. On that fateful day a tragedy happened. I erased my browser history. As it turned out not only adventure of Sasha Grey got removed but my saved password as well. I set up new account. On the old account “My watchlist” was private but “Ratings” were public so I decided to transfer them form old to new account.
